# Masters-PointClouds
This repo contains the early experiments in the preiminary stages of my Masters research. Do not come here looking for 
anything meaningfully useful, for that you should explore the forks of the three models in the [Hub Repository](https://github.com/LucHayward/Masters-Hub/).

Having said that, you may find the early data processing scripts useful, although they are painfully inefficient 
compared to those found in our [fork of Pointnet++](https://github.com/LucHayward/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch)

Masters project exploring methos to improve the automation of point cloud cleaning for large registered datasets.
